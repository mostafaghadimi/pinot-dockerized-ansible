2. Create `inventory/inventory.yml` file from the `inventory/inventory.yml.sample` file and place the `IP` and `user` of the nodes there. You can easily create a new name and place it in inventory.yml‚Äç file.

4. Execute the following command:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i <path-to-inventory-file> cluster.yml --become --become-user=root --private-key=<path-to-private-key> -v -b
  # e.g.
  ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.yml cluster.yml --become --become-user=root --private-key=~/.ssh/ssh_pk -v -b
  ```
